## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

### Before Production Use

1. **Add Real Product URLs**: Update the database with actual product URLs for each SKU-retailer combination
2. **Verify CSS Selectors**: Test and update retailer selectors if websites have changed
3. **Configure Scheduling**: Adjust scraping times based on business requirements
4. **Set Up Monitoring**: Establish procedures for health monitoring and alerting

### Sample URL Configuration
```python
# Example: Adding Flarin 12s URL for Tesco
from src.database.models import DatabaseManager
db = DatabaseManager()

with db.get_connection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO sku_retailer_urls (sku_id, retailer_id, product_url)
        VALUES (1, 1, 'https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/actual-flarin-url')
    """)
    conn.commit()
```
